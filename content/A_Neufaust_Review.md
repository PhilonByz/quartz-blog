title: A Neufaust, fanfiction well-done is powerful and lovely (and scandalous, if you will)

---

Tl;dr: a play about a college scandal, modern adaptation of Goethe’s tale about Faust’s deal with the devil, very good and provoking/provocative, fanfiction, possibly a bit obscure to those not a fan of the original.
 
[Spoilers: Dr. Faust, an unpopular and unhappy literature professor at a liberal arts college in Connecticut, falling in love with his student Gretchen, accepts the service of his teaching assistant, the devil Mephisto. With the latter’s help, Faust hooks up with Gretchen, and gives her a lot of trouble, a child, a felony for matricide, and an implied death.]
 
Despite the (seemingly) sickening plot, bequeathed by Goethe (*Faust Part I*, 1808, from which I steal all the section headings), the small-budget production gives both joy and horror, and much food for thought. The tragedy beckons the obvious question, which Mephisto raises to Faust: “Who is it that dragged her [Gretchen] to her ruin? I or you?”
 
**I am too old to kindle youthful fire,
And yet too young to be beyond desire.**
 
In both the adaptation and the original, Dr. Faust begins disillusioned with the extent one could attain knowledge, which is infinite, through academic speculations or teaching, and almost attempted suicide. In Goethe’s version, he experiments with learning by magic, wagers with Mephisto to find “out in the world […] life in rich profusion”, then falls in love with Gretchen thanks to the devil. *A Neufaust* rewrites this part: Faust falls in love with the spontaneity and originality in his student Gretchen, who doesn’t always read his reading assignments, then enlists Mephisto’s service in desire for her. No magic.
 
Among *Faust Part I*’s numerous themes, here knowledge vs. experience is downplayed: the Faust in *A Neufaust* seeks not “the whole experience of humankind” and “Mr. Universe”, only love and Gretchen. Fans of the original will sadly miss “the gold tree of life is green, all theory is grey” and Mephisto ridiculing the university curriculum. But the cherry-picking is not disappointing, for desire, now given the spotlight, is supplied with a twist.
 
In a tale about desire as a destructive force, the adapted Mephisto envies Faust for possessing desire. The devil observes human emotions with a manipulative stance, but also with longing. *A Neufaust*’s attitude towards passion is thus ambivalent: moderation is necessary. Abstract passions (like Faust’s want for knowledge and creativity), once directed towards a human being, is dangerous and misguided: love for Faust becomes a deceptive consolation. Intercourse with an inspired soul does not seem to improve the quality of his lectures. Still, passion is ultimately desirable, part of what sets us apart from the devil – the 21st-century humanized Mephisto, the self-proclaimed “spirit of perpetual negation,” grows bored with nihilism but finds desire inaccessible. In the Walpurgis party scene that never happens, Mephisto leads Faust on top of a mountain, making him realize how small and transient his strivings are, and how trifling his love. Faust rails at Mephisto, demanding to free Gretchen from imprisonment. Then the devil responses with:
 
**Why do you seek our company, if you can’t handle it?**
 
*Faust Part I*, where Mephisto plays cool magic tricks, serves as a cautionary tale against a human possessing incompatible power. *A Neufaust* strips the devil of all supernatural powers. With Goethe’s divine elements also being removed, the tragedy becomes imputable to human actions alone: this is what happens when (malevolent) human intellect (the mastermind Mephisto) serves human desires (the craving Faust). One wonders if the intellectual Faust could accomplish all this on his own, given a bit more nerve and a bottle of sus sleeping pills. Thus, possessing knowledge is revealed to be as potentially dangerous as the excessive pursuit thereof, and as problematic as being a literature professor. Again, to quote Mephisto: “Did we force ourselves on you – or was it the other way round?”
 
Of course, technical constraints cut down on the production’s setting and scope, compared to Goethe’s extravaganza (I find the original script not performable, and was happy to see many of the most lovely parts preserved): a modest budget, a cast of three, props, costumes and lightning austere but to the point. But no magic and fewer lines do not diminish the personalities on stage. Mephisto commands. Mephisto fascinates. Mephisto gives the Mephisto flair, with all the cunning, daring, and darling yapping. Gretchen is innocent and lovely, an ingénue until interesting character growth. Faust is somewhat unconvincing. Man, you are rambling. No one would listen to your lectures if you can’t speak clearly. Given that he trashed my beloved “In the beginning was the Deed” (1225ff) and “Feeling is all” (3415ff) stanzas, I won’t recommend him as my literature professor. (Or did the director make him this impotent?) Overall, superb cast.
 
**Do you know who it is, my friend, you have set free?**
 
So far I have refrained from revealing Mephisto’s pronouns: it’s she/her/hers. The calculating, gender-reversed Mephisto and the naïve Gretchen both resemble female archetypes. Only they are more complicated than that. While Mephisto is intrigued by human emotion, Gretchen is given a lot more agency and self-will in *A Neufaust*. She, not Mephisto, leads Faust out of his books and into the world of sensual experience. When her intuition, which she tends to follow, hasn’t yet given her great trouble, it produces arguably the most beautiful (and original) scene in the production. Faust gets absorbed in his book and neglects Gretchen, who nudges him mischievously, then starts flying his papers high up in the air. Faust is startled. Then he joins her, as the lovers circled across the stage, their faces glistening in shifting light, amid papers gliding like falling leaves. Then Mephisto emerges from the dark, to begrudgingly sweep away what seems to be the script of the play.
 
This “feminist-minded adaptation” (to borrow from directors’ note) also transforms Goethe’s ending, where Gretchen shows remarkable (though a bit abrupt) character growth. To be executed (that’s a goof: Connecticut has abolished the death penalty), she refuses to escape with Faust: not in a madness as per Goethe, but conscious and determined, having no fantasy for a bygone love or a life spent in regret. There is an intriguing change from the original, which writes:  
MEPHISTO: “She is condemned!”  
A VOICE [from above]: “Redeemed!”
 
In *A Neufaust* we have:  
MEPHISTO: “She is condemned!”  
FAUST [deadpan]: “I… think she is redeemed…”  
In a world without the divine, who gets to decide?
 
I don’t think Faust has the moral authority, at least, however much ethics he has read. What Gretchen realized in prison could be the dark underside of the Faust story, made more explicit by the post-MeToo college setting. A scandal in iambic pentameters is disgraceful nonetheless: power inequity, exploitation, and manipulation in the name of some pursuit pure and profound (a contemporary example: Gabriel Matzneff). To Faust, is Gretchen her own person, or merely the symbol of youth and life, that he is dire to possess and fated to lose? Yet, are not our protagonists symbols to the viewer, and therefore remote and justifiable? *A Neufaust* is very much removed from time and space: no mention of tenure track, politics, or local news headlines. One might say the play itself romanticizes the scandalous: at curtain I found the tale woeful, only much later revolting. Literature’s prowess – to dress up the bad and devilish – is as dangerous as the unrest spurred by some higher goal.
 
**Into my own beloved native tongue.**
 
Yet there is a similar danger: of turning an adaptation into a parody. Every production alluding to an old play (with varying degrees of freedom) desires to bring something new to what is already there. The question is: does the audience, or the director, know what is already there? Is there really something new, and if so, really in conversation with the old?
 
I wonder if a Lady Capulet in sweatpants brings in anything more meaningful than a modest costume budget (or should I understand the theme of Romeo and Juliet to be consumerism?). Dislocating any play to 21st-century America is not the most ingenious and brilliant idea – often it’s an intellectually easy fix, to hide the absence of any original message. Formal transplant is not the end, only the means to connect old-timey themes with sound contemporary critiques, a bridge that is often precarious. For the non-fans, such disjunction could be weird and baffling; for the fans, it’s out of character.
 
If I were to ever write fanfiction (which I don’t), I will tell myself to first have a message, then find a setting that serves the message. It is fine to even not have a new message. *A Neufaust* (or writing fanfiction in general) speaks eloquently that there are themes universal enough to resonate throughout the centuries, without the remoteness that demands modern recasting (Having learned that the ancients shared the same vexations, I walked out of theater feeling a little bit better about myself).
 
It is possible to be obsessed with innovation for innovation’s sake, and to disvalue understanding the original, or reflecting upon its continuous appeal. The reason for this, I guess, could be two-fold. We might believe that we are the most exceptional people throughout all ages, and that old problems can’t be compared with the new ones facing us now. In the meantime, we might leave it to Large Language Models to digest and flesh out the subtleties in humanity’s past intellectual output.
 
Both reasons make sense. I will not dispute them. But I also doubt if I am writing anything new. Are we really as innovative as we see ourselves to be? How can we know that if not knowing what is out there? When generative AI is radically redefining (human) creativity, we should perhaps be reminded that its ability to create, or appear to create, stems from meaningful interactions with the past. An adaptation is, likewise, not a singularity but part of a long conversation. And we should listen, with all due respect, so we know what makes a voice lasting, and better heard.
 
In the middle of the play there was a medley of film clips, all featuring people, each in their own way, drunken and astray in love’s revelries. This included F.W. Murnau’s 1926 adaptation *Faust*, where Gretchen’s stilted, robotic movements signal love’s paralysis, as well as the alienated human body, brought by an industrializing and mechanizing age. The feminist Gretchen in *A Neufaust* is a pleasant surprise. But, to borrow a word from Mephisto, “She is not the first!”

I was inspired to write this review after reading a very disappointing book review in the school newspaper. An inquiry reveals that the newspaper allows only publishing under one's real name. I decided to reap the benefits of modern self-publishing. Hence this blog and hence you are here.

title: How to read a book/paper?

---

## Question 0: What should I read, and in what depth?

Read a (recent) review article first and locate potential titles. 

Create a list of things I might read, sort through it.

Read the abstract of each item in the list. Then write a note, choosing between:
 - Only get a sense
 - Seriously read
 - Extract a part/result, and blackbox it
 - Don't understand

Sort the list again.

## I want to skim
Allow yourself to skim -- not understanding 100% is not a sin! Set a timer to limit the time, and don't get bogged in the weeds. Remind yourself *why* you are reading. Then read.

Read in any order you like, no need to progress linearly.

But you should still take something away. In the notes, write down:
- the topic: what do the authors talk about?
- the argument: what is new in the article?
- the approach: how do the authors arrive at their argument?

## I want to read seriously

##### Piece of advice 1: read the conclusion before the introduction
Some history books don't have an argument (sourcebooks). 
Some do. For the latter, read the conclusions before reading the introduction. Why? Conclusions are much easier to write: you already have the argument, so you comfortably recap. Introductions are really hard to write, and hard to read as well.

##### Piece of advice 2: do these things please

- skim: get an overview
- ask: raise some questions
- read: answer the questions as you read
- recall: summarize the sections *without looking at the text*. If you cannot recall, stand up and walk around. Recalling helps you spot the flaw in the argument.
- review: write down your thoughts

My thoughts: asking and recalling are helpful. But is this really practical?

##### Piece of advice 3: take notes (or you will regret it)
Make notes while reading, then after you finish the book, read the notes again. 
When referencing this book/making a presentation/writing a book review, start from the notes.

How to take notes?
- definitions and clarifications
- summaries of sections
- keep track of page numbers, important sources for easy reference
- reconstruct whole arguments, ideally without looking at the book: see how the author gets to the conclusion, how to make arguments
- copy down good arguments
- copy quotes, but only one to two sentences for each point
- write your own comments
- create a diagram of the flow of the article
- map *conversations between articles*

## Misc and nice

Know thyself!
- What will make me lose attention? Then anticipate them.
- What makes me read productively? Location, posture, people around you, time (schedule blocks or squeeze it in), sound, device ...

Always read critically!
- what assumptions are there?
- where do I see holes?
- logic of the paper OK?

How to get a big picture of what the paper is talking about?
- read other papers that cite this one: there will be a one-sentence summary of the most important message :P
